# About NextGen Browser
NextGen was an idea, back in 2017 when codenamed 'Pixlox' made a simple browser in C++. After that Pixlox tried recoding Chromium and Firefox. Them, having their own problems being: Chromium not supporting H.264 and other closed source media codecs and Firefox not having good code for making a completely different browser. So there laid Brave, Powered by Chromium but having closed source codecs, and good code. Pixlox only discovered Brave in January 2019. Starting Development in Febuary 2019; Pixlox had made *NextGen Alpha* by March but only releasing it to his friends. Then he abandoned the project in Late March and went to Unreal Engine to make games. He came back 
in May to finish the project. Nowadays Pixlox has a balance between Unreal Engine Development and NextGen Development. So, Now You Know The History; Maybe you can download it. *Come on, I know you haven't!*
